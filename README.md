Terminal2048
============

Command line version of the popular game 2048

Written in C++

For all those times when you really want to play 2048, but all
you have is a terminal-based computer without internet access

To compile this version, simply run the default make command

To create your own View, define a class that inherits from View
and implements the pure virtual functions. Then change any references
to the terminal view in controller.cpp to your own view.
Last but not least, update your makefile!
